# Hi there, my name is Rena Hashimi ðŸ‘‹
I am a Front-end Developer student at Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media.

## About me
I am 34 years old and live in Oslo. I am married, mother of two beautiful children and work full-time in optics. With all this on the plate, I am also studying Front-end developer at the Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media and have now completed my first year (March2024).

Since I can remember, I have always had a great passion for IT, coding, web development and design. After working in customer service for almost 16 years, it was time for a career change and I decided to fulfill my dream of becoming a developer.
